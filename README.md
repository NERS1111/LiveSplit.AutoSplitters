# LiveSplit.AutoSplitters
This is where I post my LiveSplit autosplitters.
RPG Maker MV autosplitters use samjones246's plugin, so rename them to Autosplitter.json and put them in your game's folder.

I've also contributed to a couple of other people's autosplitters, namely:
- Tenebrosful's DELTARUNE Chapter 1&2 autosplitter;
- cccarl / SunglassesEmoji's OneShot 2016 autosplitter.
